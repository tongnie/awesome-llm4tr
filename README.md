## üìñ Framework and Taxonomy
*Definition*: **LLM4TR** refers to the methodological paradigm that systematically harnesses emergent capabilities of LLMs to enhance transportation tasks through four synergistic roles: transforming raw data into understandable insights, distilling domain-specific knowledge into computable structures, synthesizing adaptive system components, and orchestrating optimal decisions. We survey the existing literature and summarize how LLMs are exploited to solve transportation problems from a methodological perspective, i.e., the roles of LLMs in transportation systems. They generally include four aspects:
